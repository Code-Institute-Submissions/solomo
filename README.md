# SoLoMo

SoLoMo is a website which offers a three pronged strategy for Local Business Marketing.  
The word "SoLoMo" is an acronym for "Social Local Mobile".

- Social - Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
- Local - Is about creating an internet presence focused on geographic location.
- Mobile - Refers to mobile first design. A website primarily optimised for phones and mobile devices.

The SoLoMo website offers products based on various combinations of the above.  
There are three products;  Solo, Duo & Trio.

## UX

My primary design goal for this site was to convey the simplicity of the SoLoMo marketing strategy.  
I used design elements in groups of three to really drive home the concept of the SoLoMo three pronged approach to Local Business Marketing. I started with three strong colours for the logo, changed the colour scheme of the video to match, and used those same colours for the basis of the main design. The three product bundles, featuring three digital media services, were arranged in three columns and, where applicable, the same theme was followed throughout the layout right down to the three column footer.

I wanted the site to be very simple and cheerful but still communicate a powerful commercial message which is easily understood.

Customers should immediately identify with the concept and readily determine which product applies to them.


### User Story

Stan is a plumber.  
He runs his own business offering commercial and domestic plumbing services to his clients.  
As a small business owner Stan wants to attract new business closer to his home so he can increase productivity by spending less time driving and more time working on jobs.  

What Stan needs is a website to advertise his business which is Search Engine Optimised for his location and targets customers in his local area.

### Solution

SoLoMo is a website which can provide Stan with the products he needs to achieve his goals.  
The SoLoMo website has three product bundles from which to choose.

- Solo: A mobile first designed website. For users who already have Social Media & Google Maps
- Duo: A mobile first designed website + Google Maps. For users who already have Social Media
- Trio: A mobile first designed website + Google Maps + Social Media

When Stan visits the SoLoMo website he is presented with a concise statement which reassures him that he's in the right place. A prominent call to action invites Stan to "Learn More" and further secondary call to action buttons offer information or the option to get a product.  

The "Learn More" and "Info" buttons will bring Stan to the "About" page where he will find a short video explaining everything he needs to know about the SoLoMo strategy.  

The "Get" buttons bring Stan to the Products page where he can purchase his chosen product.
